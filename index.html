<!--
pseudo code:

3 steps:
initialize game, play game, end of game


initialize game:
In main body/outer container: I want a timer JSS (should this give you a time limit that works with WHOLE QUIZ.
I want a win/loss tracker


play game:
CSS
I want a box with 4 possible questions, each encased in their own box that you can click which will submit that as the answer.

CSS
I want a button that says START GAME that should be hidden after pressing

CSS
I want a button that says NEXT QUESTION that should be hidden UNTIL starting game.

CSS
There should be a hover effect and a before/after that changes colors when clicked. Think about using the keydown method.

JS
All questions should appear in a random order using the Math.random() method


end of game:
CSS AND JS
I want a button (CSS) that says CLEAR HIGH SCORES (JS)

CSS OR JS (UNSURE)
I want the START GAME button to also appear here to iniitalize another new game. that means, go back to SHOW.

JS
when game finishes an alert stating ALL DONE should appear along your final score and a prompt for you to input your initials. final score and initials should be kept using the localStorage method.

JSS
I want my timer to stop counting

JS
I want my timer to reset
