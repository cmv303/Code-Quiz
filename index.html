<!--
pseudo code:

3 steps:
initialize game, play game, end of game


initialize game:
In main body/outer container: I want a timer (should this give you a time limit that works with WHOLE QUIZ.
I want a win/loss tracker


play game:
I want a box with 4 possible questions, each encased in their own box that you can click which will submit that as the answer.

There should be a hover effect and a before/after that changes colors when clicked. Think about using the keydown method.

All questions should appear in a random order using the Math.random() method

The larger box should have:

I want a button that says START GAME that should be hidden after pressing

I want a button that says NEXT QUESTION that should be hidden UNTIL starting game.


end of game:
when game finishes an alert stating ALL DONE should appear along your final score and a prompt for you to input your initials. final score and initials should be kept using the localStorage method.

I want a button that says CLEAR HIGH SCORES
I want my timer to stop counting

I want a button the START GAME button to also appear here to iniitalize another new game. that means, go back to SHOW.

I want my timer to reset
